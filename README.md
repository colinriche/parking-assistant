# parking_assistant

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Geofencing is a technology that creates virtual boundaries around a particular area using GPS
coordinates. These virtual boundaries can be used to trigger an action when a person or object
enters or exits the designated area. In this whitepaper, we will discuss how geofencing, Google
Maps, and speed monitoring can be used to create a car parking assistant that is part of an app
that logs a vehicle every time it enters into a location that has or is suspected to have an ANPR
camera (Automatic Number Plate Recognition). In the UK the private parking industry is out of
control, issuing as many parking fines to unsuspecting motorists that it can for the slightest
infringement.
